# Surena

Surena is a tool designed to help you assess whether your Docker daemon has vulnerabilities. It utilizes Click, a Python CLI library, for its development.

With Surena, you can determine if your Docker daemon is vulnerable. Additionally, it illustrates potential security risks when Docker daemons expose ports insecurely. We've also written an article on Medium explaining how Surena works. You can access the article [here](#).

## Installation

You can install Surena from PyPI by executing the following command:

```bash
pip install surena
```

Once installed, you can access its help feature using the following command. Surena is user-friendly due to its utilization of the Click library:

```bash
surena --help
```

Note: Surena is intended for lab use and for understanding whether your Docker daemon is secure or insecure. DO NOT USE SURENA FOR MALICIOUS ACTIVITIES.
