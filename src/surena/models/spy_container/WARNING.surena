Your Docker daemon may have vulnerabilities, and you might inadvertently expose its port to the internet without considering security issues. We have written an article on Medium that explains how hackers can gain shell access through the Docker daemon. Please prioritize securing your Docker daemon promptly.

If you're unable to spare time to read our Medium article, you can refer to this link for guidance on securing your Docker daemon: https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/protect-access/
